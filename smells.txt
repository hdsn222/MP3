Question 1:
This type of code smell is duplicating code. We have duplicate expressions in the same class. We have duplicate methods in the same class.
We could fix this by using one method for both cases instead of having two methods do the exact same thing. 

Question 2: 
We moved the two statements into a method named updateAndTrim in the Nodes class

Question 3: 
The method does not belong in the Nodes class. This would be feature envy. We can fix this by moving the method to the correct class.

Question 4:
This type of code smell is duplicating code. We have dublicated statements in the same class. To fix this, we could create a method and then call the method in the four locations where the repeat statements are found. 

Question 5: We extracted the three repeated statements to a method named generateKeyPairWithSpec.

Question 6:
